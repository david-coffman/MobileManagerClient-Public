# MobileManagerClient-Public
Public version of the MobileManagerClient repository.

### Purpose
MobileManagerClient receives data exports from MobileManager. In a larger-scale campaign, the Client app would be used by field workers, who would use the app as a checklist (presented as a map or an actual list) to track voter engagements.
