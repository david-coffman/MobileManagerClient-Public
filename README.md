# MobileManagerClient-Public
Public version of the MobileManagerClient repository.

### Purpose
MobileManagerClient receives data exports from MobileManager (Dispatch). In a larger-scale campaign, the Client app would be used by field workers, who would use the app as a checklist (presented as a map or an actual list) to track voter engagements. These digital checklists can then be sent back to Dispatch, where the engagements are tracked in aggregate.
